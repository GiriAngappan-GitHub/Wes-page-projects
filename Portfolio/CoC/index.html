                    <p class="fw-bold pl-2">Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which each player is a village chief. Every player builds their village by using resources and trains troops to attack other player villages to gain resources and trophies. Players can (and usually do) form communities called clans, which are groups of up to 50 people. Clans players can donate troops to each other and can go on war with other clans. There are four currencies or resources in the game: Gold, Elixir, Dark Elixir, Gems. Gold and elixir are used to build and upgrade buildings like defenses, resource collectors etc. Elixir and Dark Elixir are also used to upgrade troops and spells. In the past, they were also used to train the troops but since July 2022 training is made free.Gems are the premium currency. They can be earned by completing in-game achievements or bought using real money. Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.</p>

The Barbarian King only defends his territory around his platform and will retreat if lured too far out. If the village is attacked while he is regenerating health, his altar will be empty. If he locks onto a troop, he will follow that troop until he dies or that troop is killed. Once the troop is killed, and he is outside of his patrol zone, he will return to patrolling around his altar, even if the altar is destroyed. You do not need to knock out the Barbarian King (or any Hero other than the Grand Warden) to three star a base.</p>

Their first target are resourcebuildings making them the ideal troop to deploy if your primary concern from a raid is collecting resources. They deal double damage to resourcebuildings (goldmines, elixircollectors and storages for each). This means that they deal more than 2x as much damage as Barbarians and 3x as much as Archers to these types of buildings! The trade off is their relatively low health which is higher than an Archer but lower than a Barbarian. Because the nature of the character is to attack resourcebuildings first, ignoring all defenses, they can be vulnerable to attack and should not be deployed without another type of troop for</p>
