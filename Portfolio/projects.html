      <h1>Image Search App</h1>
      <p>
        I'm showcasing my project called 'Image Search App.'
        <br />
        It's a website I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        <br />
        It lets you search for pictures using words. I used a API called the
        Unsplash API to get the pictures. When you type in a word, like 'car' or
        'dog,' the app asks the Unsplash website for pictures related to that
        word and shows them to you. It was a project I did to learn how to use
        the API.
